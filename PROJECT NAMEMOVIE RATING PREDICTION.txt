                                            PROJECT NAME:MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON


INTRODUCTION

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the ratings of movies based on their features such as genre, director, and main actors. We'll use data from IMDb, which provides information about many movies, including their ratings. By analyzing this data and using regression techniques, we aim to build a model that can estimate a movie's rating before it's released. This could help movie producers, critics, and fans get an early idea of how a movie might be received.

DATA COLLECTION	

My source here is have used IMDb datasets from Kaggle using IMDbPY library

The attributes are:
Movie title
Genre
Director
Main actors
Release year
IMDb rating

DATA PREPROCESSING

Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicate values, and inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical data (e.g., genre, director, actors) into numerical representations using techniques like label encoding.
Normalize numerical features if necessary.
Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

MODEL BUILDING

Feature Selection: Select important features which are important and impact the rating.
Model Selection: Choose regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

MODEL TRAINING

Implementation: Implement it with different regression models on the training dataset to test the flexibility of the model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.

EVALUATION

Evaluate the model using Techniques like Recall,Precision,Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

Model Deployment

Model Deployment is the model which we have been trained to make is use in the real world scenarios or simply to apply the model in the environment to know how it works and which helps to improve it better with drawbacks by using the model upon untrained data.
Best Model: Select the model with the best performance metrics.
Predictions: Use the model to predict ratings for unseen movies or any new movies.

CONCLUSION

Summarize the findings and the performance of the model.
Discuss potential and further improvements and future work.

Code Implementation

Below is the code for the project:

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
import joblib

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')  # Assume a CSV file with movie data

# Data Preprocessing
data = data.dropna()  # Dropping missing values for simplicity

#Feature engineering
encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
encoded_features = encoder.fit_transform(data[['genre', 'director', 'actors']])

# Combine encoded features with numerical features
features = pd.concat([data[['year']], pd.DataFrame(encoded_features.toarray())], axis=1)
ratings = data['rating']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, ratings, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model Training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f'MAE: {mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'MSE: {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(f'R²: {r2_score(y_test, y_pred)}')

# Save the model
joblib.dump(model, 'movie_rating_predictor.pkl')

//This project involves various steps from data collection and preprocessing to model building and evaluation
